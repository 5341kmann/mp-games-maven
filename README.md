# Abstract games

A mini-project for Grinnell's CSC-207.

Authors:

* Sarah Deschamps
* Grant Sackmann
* Samuel A. Rebelsky (Starter code)

Instructions:

* The object of this game is to connect four of your pieces in a row. This can be done
  vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
* The game board is filled with X's, O's, and blanks. X's represent Player 1, 
  while O's represent Player 2.
* During gameplay, you can choose the column to put your next piece into. This is done
  by typing numbers 1 through 7 in the command line, representing the columns.
* In one-player Connect 4, you will be Player 1 (represented by X's), and the computer
  will play as Player 2 (represented by O's).
* In two-player Connect 4, Player 1 (the first person who goes) is represented by X's, while
  Player 2 (the second person who goes) is represented by O's.
* The game will end as soon as one player has connected four of their pieces or the board
  fills up, whichever happens first.
